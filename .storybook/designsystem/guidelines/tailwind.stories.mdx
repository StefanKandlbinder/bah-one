# TailwindCSS

## Introduction
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) provides a very practicable way, to automatically generate utility classes, based on a json config file.
They are very similiar to the classes we are alreading using in our desktop application, like `l-mt0` which represents `margin-top: 0` -
the tailwind couterpart e.g. is `m-0`, see [tailwind margin utility classes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/margin).

## Config
Inside `tailwind.config.js` i created a basic set (76kB) of utility classes which could be handy for us.
This can always be tweaked for our needs.
The config is based on the Global Design Tokens and there should never be component based design tokens in it.

## Angular Integration
To integrate Tailwind into angular without ejecting it, i was following this article [UPDATED: Angular 11 and TailwindCSS 2](https://jacobneterer.medium.com/angular-and-tailwindcss-2388fb6e0bab).
